# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## Tasks in Phase 1
- Requirement Gathering  
- Stakeholder Analysis  
- Business Process Mapping  
- Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis  
- AppExchange Exploration

## Requirement Gathering
### Problem Statement
Currently, the CSBS branch relies on **manual processes**:
- Attendance tracked on paper or spreadsheets.
- Marks managed in multiple Excel files.
- Announcements sent via WhatsApp groups.
- Reports generated manually, which is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.

### Solution
A Salesforce-based centralized system to:
- Manage **student and faculty profiles**.
- Track **attendance and marks** in real-time.
- Provide a **single portal for announcements**.
- Generate **reports and dashboards** for analytics.
- Offer role-based access for Admin, Faculty, and Students.

| Attendance Tracking| Faculty can directly mark attendance in Salesforce |

## Stakeholder Analysis

| Student            | Views attendance, marks, and announcements | Read-Only Access |
| System Developer   | Builds and maintains the Salesforce system | Developer Access |

## Business Process Mapping
| Action      | Old Process            | New Process (Salesforce) |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Attendance | Paper/Excel          | Faculty directly updates Salesforce |
| Marks      | Excel Sheets         | Marks stored in Salesforce |
| Announcements | WhatsApp/Verbal     | Centralized announcements portal |
| Reports    | Manual Compilation    | Auto-generated dashboards |

## Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis

|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Blackboard               | LMS, grading, communication    | Complex setup, not department-specific |
| Coursera for Campus      | Learning and skill development | Lacks attendance and marks tracking |
| Salesforce Education Cloud | Recruitment, alumni, lifecycle management | Too broad for small-scale department use |

## AppExchange Exploration
| App Name                  | Key Features                      | Why Not Fully Suitable |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Salesforce Education Cloud | Full student lifecycle management | Overly complex for a single branch |
| Attendance Management System | Basic attendance and reporting   | Lacks marks and announcement modules |
